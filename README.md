# BuildCache icx Wrapper
This wrapper enables the use of Intel C++ compiler (icx) with [BuildCache](https://gitlab.com/bits-n-bites/buildcache), a great tool that speeds up builds by caching compilation results.

# Usage
Copy icx_wrapper.lua to your BuildCache root directory and you should be good to go.
